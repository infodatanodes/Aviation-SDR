## Software Installed on Pi

| Software | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| RTLSDR-Airband (approach) | **Active** | `rtl-airband-approach.service` — dedicated 132.922 MHz, SN:00000001, Icecast `/approach` |
| RTLSDR-Airband (scanner) | **Active** | `rtl-airband-scan.service` — multichannel 125.025/125.350/126.550 MHz, SN:00000002, Icecast `/scan` |
| airband_display.py | **Active** | `airband-display.service` — curses UI on tty1, two-panel layout |
| transfer_recordings.sh | **Active** | Cron every 2 min — SCPs MP3s to main PC `C:/ProScan/Recordings/Aviation-SDR/` |
| Icecast2 | **Active** | Port 8010 — `/approach` (dedicated) + `/scan` (scanner) mounts |
| readsb v3.16.10 | Installed (disabled) | ADS-B decoder — no dedicated dongle assigned yet |
| tar1090 | Running (stale) | Web map at `http://100.68.206.39/tar1090/` — reads from readsb (currently inactive) |
| rtl_test/rtl_fm/rtl_power | Installed | Blog fork versions at `/usr/local/bin/` |
| librtlsdr (Blog fork) | Installed | Built from source at `/usr/local/lib/` — required for V4 |

## Resolved Issues

1. **"SDR wedged" crash** — Root cause: `rtl_airband` was auto-starting on boot and claiming the USB device before readsb. Fix: `sudo systemctl disable rtl_airband`.
2. **Wrong librtlsdr** — Debian's stock `librtlsdr0` doesn't properly support V4's R828D tuner in async mode. Fix: removed Debian package, rebuilt Blog fork from source, rebuilt readsb from source.
3. **Location set** — `sudo readsb-set-location 32.75 -97.33` (Fort Worth area).
4. **Older dongle removed** — RTL2838UHIDIR unplugged, USB bus stable.
5. **Scan mode fails with LNA+splitter** — Scan mode hops too fast across frequencies; squelch never opens because dwell time is too short with amplified noise floor. Fix: switched to multichannel mode (dongle stays parked, demodulates all channels simultaneously within ~2.3 MHz bandwidth).
6. **20GB debug log filling SD card** — `-e` flag on rtl_airband services wrote `/rtl_airband_debug.log` continuously. Fix: removed `-e` flag from both service files. Disk went from 92% to 25%.
7. **Old rtl-airband.service crash-looping** — Stale original service (18,925 restarts) fighting for device 0. Fix: disabled, replaced by `rtl-airband-approach` and `rtl-airband-scan` services pinned by serial number.

## Lessons Learned

- **Never use `-e` flag in production** — debug logging writes GB/day to root filesystem
- **Multichannel mode > scan mode** when using LNA — ~2.3 MHz bandwidth limit per dongle, but no missed transmissions
- **Pin dongles by serial number**, not index — indices can swap on reboot
- **Dallas Approach (125.350)** shows zero activity from this location — may need different freq
- **Dallas Love ATIS (127.000)** is a robot weather loop — exclude from pipeline to avoid wasted Whisper cycles
- **DFW Clearance (126.550)** has most noise of the monitored channels — candidate for audio filtering

## Log Management

- **transfer_logs.sh**: Runs daily 3 AM via cron, transfers CSV/logs to `C:\ProScan\Recordings\Aviation-SDR\logs\` with date stamps, truncates on Pi
- **transfer_recordings.sh**: Runs every 2 min via cron, SCPs MP3s to main PC, deletes local

## Known Issues

1. **DNS on Pi** — Tailscale DNS resolver doesn't forward to public DNS. Fix: manually set `nameserver 8.8.8.8` in `/etc/resolv.conf` (Tailscale may overwrite on restart).
2. **WiFi instead of Ethernet** — Pi is on WiFi (wlan0). Should use wired Ethernet for stability.
3. **Dallas Approach (125.350) silent** — Zero activity in 1-hour test. May not be active freq for this location.

### Military
- 225-400 MHz UHF AM — NAS Fort Worth JRB, Carswell Field

## Integration with Spacenodes Ops Center

### Active — VHF Airband → Map Integration (March 2026)
1. Pi records VHF airband transmissions as per-transmission MP3s
2. `transfer_recordings.sh` SCPs MP3s to main PC every 2 min → `C:\ProScan\Recordings\Aviation-SDR\`
3. `recording_watcher.py` aviation worker picks up files, transcribes with Whisper (aviation-specific prompt)
4. Callsign extracted: airline+digits ("American 1415"→AAL1415), N-number, or ICAO code
5. WebSocket broadcasts `aviation_transmission` to map
6. **Map**: aircraft with matching callsign gets blue glow ring (#00bfff), popup shows ATC Radio section with audio player
7. Tower frequency transmissions show 📡 marker at airport coordinates
8. All indicators fade after 10 minutes

**Key files on Spacenodes side**: `recording_watcher.py` (aviation worker), `map.html` (glow + popup), `aviation_log.db` (transmission history)
**API**: `GET /api/aviation-log?callsign=AAL1415` — query transmission history

**POC results** (30 recordings): Whisper turbo extracted callsigns from 37% (11/30 — 8 clean hits)

### Active — Air Traffic Tracking
- `ercot_proxy.py` polls airplanes.live API for ADS-B aircraft data
- Displays aircraft as a layer on the Spacenodes map dashboard

### Future
- Replace airplanes.live with local readsb JSON API from Pi (when dedicated ADS-B dongle is set up)
- Fallback to airplanes.live if Pi is unreachable
- Add ACARS text messages as a data feed (decoded aircraft communications)
- UAT data provides FIS-B weather info — potential weather layer source

### readsb API Endpoint
```
http://100.68.206.39/tar1090/data/aircraft.json
```
Same JSON format as airplanes.live — near-drop-in replacement once dedicated dongle is assigned.

## NotebookLM Research

Aviation research notebook exists in NotebookLM (ID: 5d5b971c) with 13 YouTube sources covering:
- ADS-B setup with readsb on Raspberry Pi
- Dual ADS-B + UAT monitoring
- ACARS decoding with acarsdec
- VHF airband monitoring
- Antenna considerations (need separate antennas for 1090 MHz vs VHF)
